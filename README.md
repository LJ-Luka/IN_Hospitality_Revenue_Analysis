## Project Summary

### About the project  

The project is an analysis of the hospitality revenue in India. Four major cities are involved, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.  </br>
There are key metrics used in the hospitality industry, Revenue, Occupancy Rate, Realisation Rate, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN), Revenue Per Available Rooms (RevPAR), Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN) and Daily Utilised Room Nights (DURN). Some of these metrics are assessed and trends are identified. </br>
The stakeholder provided the requirements for the dashboard they need. They also provided a mock-up dashboard as a guide. Halfway through the project, feedback is received on satisfaction and further expectations for the dashboard. The final dashboard is made considering all the requirements of the stakeholder.  </br>
The dashboard is interactive. It lets you interact with the data by tracking, monitoring, and displaying key business metrics. It lets you drill down into the data, filter and manipulate it.  </br>  
### The steps involved in this project

- Imported data from the source (5 .csv files)
- Used power query to transform and clean the data: checked for blanks, deleted unwanted columns, checked headers for consistency and loaded data. This demonstrates proficiency with the ETL process.
- Modelled the data using the Star Schema. This was done to establish relationships between the tables (using the primary and foreign keys).
- Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures for the analysis.
- Created the dashboard and showed insights using various visualisation. Drill down and tooltips were used to show in-depth insights into some tiles.
