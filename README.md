## Project Summary

### About the project  

The project is an analysis of the hospitality revenue in India. Four major cities are involved, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.  </br>
The stakeholder provided a set of requirements. The requirements included key metrics used in the hospitality industry, Revenue, Occupancy Rate, Realisation Rate, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN), Revenue Per Available Rooms (RevPAR), Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN) and Daily Utilised Room Nights (DURN). Some of these metrics are assessed and trends are identified. </br>
A mock-up was drawn to serve as a guide for the final dashboard. Halfway through the project, feedback was received on satisfaction and further expectations for the dashboard. The final dashboard was made considering all the requirements of the stakeholder  </br>
The dashboard is interactive. It lets you interact with the data by tracking, monitoring, and displaying key business metrics. It lets you drill down into the data, filter and manipulate it  </br>  
### The steps involved in this project

- Imported data from the source (5 .csv files)
- Used power query to transform and clean the data: checked for blanks, deleted unwanted columns, checked headers for consistency and loaded data. This demonstrates proficiency with the ETL process.
- The data was modelled using the Star Schema. This was done to establish relationships between the tables (using the primary and foreign keys).
- Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), were used to create calculated columns and measures for the analysis.
- The dashboard was created using different charts and visualisations and gives key hospitality revenue insights. Drill down and tooltips were used to show in-depth insights into some tiles.
