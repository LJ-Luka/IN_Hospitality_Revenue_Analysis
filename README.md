## Project Summary

### About the project  

The project is an analysis of the hospitality revenue in India. Four major cities are involved, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.  </br>
The stakeholder has provided a set of requirements. The requirements include key metrics used in the hospitality industry, Revenue, Occupancy Rate, Realisation Rate, Average Daily Rate (ADR), Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN), Revenue Per Available Rooms (RevPAR), Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN) and Daily Utilised Room Nights (DURN). The stakeholder also desires a monthly filter, weekly filter to show week on week changes, and filters for city, property, room type and platform. </br>
A mock-up is drawn to serve as a guide for the final dashboard. Halfway through the project, feedback is received on satisfaction and further expectations for the dashboard. The final dashboard is made considering all the requirements of the stakeholder.  </br>
The dashboard is interactive. It lets you interact with the data by tracking, monitoring, and displaying key business metrics. It lets you drill down into the data, filter and manipulate it.  </br>  
### The steps involved in this project

- Data importation from the source (5 .csv files)
- Utilisation of power query to transform and clean the data: check for blanks, delete unwanted columns, check headers for consistency and load data. This demonstrates proficiency with the ETL process.
- The data is modelled using the Star Schema. This is done to establish relationships between the tables (using the primary and foreign keys).
- Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), are used to create calculated columns and measures for the analysis.
- The dashboard is created using different charts and visualisations and gives key hospitality revenue insights. Drill down and tooltips are used to show in-depth insights into some tiles. </br>
